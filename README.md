# PayID @ https://kramer.money

This repository hosts web content powering [https://kramer.money](https://kramer.money), which demonstrates 
how a domain can become [PayID-enabled](https://payid.org/) with a minimal amount of effort (i.e., host it on
 [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).
 
Currently, the context includes a PayID (pay$kramer.money), which is [PayID Discovery](https://github.com/payid-org/rfcs/blob/master/dist/spec/payid-discovery.html)
and PayID Easy Checkout enabled.
